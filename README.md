## Introduction

Seek And Catch is a simple yet addictive mobile game where players click on items within a grid to score points. The game features different levels with increasing difficulty, requiring players to be quick and accurate in their selections.

## Gameplay

### Starting the Game
- Upon starting the game, the player is presented with a grid of items.
- A specific item is highlighted as the "goal" which the player needs to click on to score points.

### Clicking Mechanics
- Clicking on the correct item increases the player's coefficient and adds score points.
- Clicking on the wrong item decreases the coefficient.
